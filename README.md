<h2 align="center"> HateBR - A Benchmark Dataset for Offensive Language and Hate Speech in Brazilian Portuguese </h2>  

</br>
<p align="justify"> HateBR is the first large-scale expert annotated dataset of Brazilian Instagram comments for abusive language detection on the web and social media. The HateBR was collected from Brazilian Instagram comments of politicians and manually annotated by specialists. It is composed of 7,000 documents annotated according to three different layers: a binary classification (offensive versus non-offensive comments), offensiveness-level (highly, moderately, and slightly offensive messages), and hate speech targets. Each comment was annotated by three different expert annotators and achieved high inter-annotator agreement. Furthermore, baseline experiments were implemented outperforming the current literature dataset baselines for the Portuguese language. We hope that the proposed expert annotated dataset may foster research on hate speech detection in the Natural Language Processing area. </p>

</br>
<h3 align="center">***UPDATE***: <u>HateBR</u> and <u>HateBRXplain</u> new versions are available</h3>

<p align="justify"> This repository contains the corpus and the best models presented in the LREC's paper (see section "CITING / BIBTEX"). 
The following image and tables provide detailed definitions of offensive language and hate speech used to label the corpus, along with the number of samples for each class:

### HateBR 
<div align="center">

| class         | label | total  |
|--------------|-------|--------|
| offensive    | 1     | 3,500  |
| non-offensive | 0    | 3,500  |
| **Total**    |       | **7,000** |

</div>

### HateBRXplain 

<div align="center">

| class         | label | rationales                     | total  |
|--------------|-------|--------------------------------|--------|
| offensive    | 1     | human-annotated rationales    | 3,500  |
| non-offensive | 0    | null                          | 3,500  |
| **Total**    |       |                                | **7,000** |

</div>


</br>

In addition, we also provide baseline machine learning results for both tasks: offensive language and hate speech detection. The best-obtained models are available here in .pkl files. File names are organized as `[classification (offensive or hate)_representation (ngram or tfidf)_algorithms (nb, svm, mlp or lr)]`. For example, the file *offensive_tfidf_svm.pkl* presents the model of offensive detection with tf-idf representation using the support vector machine algorithm.
